## Why Share Essential Business Logic?

In modern app development, keeping **business logic separate from UI logic** is not just a best practice—it’s a necessity. However, too often, crucial business logic remains deeply intertwined with UI components, making it harder to test, reuse, and scale. **This post advocates for sharing essential use cases of business logic** and demonstrates how Riverpod can help achieve cleaner architecture.

### Problems with UI-Coupled Business Logic

1. **Lack of Reusability** – Business logic gets tightly coupled with widgets, making it hard to reuse in different parts of the app.
2. **Poor Testability** – Testing UI-bound logic requires unnecessary widget testing instead of straightforward unit tests.
3. **Harder Maintenance** – When logic is mixed with UI, any change in the UI might unintentionally affect the core behavior.

By **sharing minimal, essential use cases of business logic**, we can:

- Help others understand the core functionality without UI distractions.
- Improve modularity and scalability.
- Make contributions easier by exposing clear logic units.

## Keeping Business Logic Separate with Riverpod

Riverpod is an excellent state management solution that naturally enforces separation between UI and business logic. A good example is managing a `ScaffoldMessengerState` as a global repository, independent of UI concerns.

### Example:

```dart
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
GlobalKey<ScaffoldMessengerState> messenger(Ref ref) =>
    GlobalKey<ScaffoldMessengerState>();
```

### How to Plug in `messenger`

To integrate this provider into your app, use:

```dart
final scaffoldMessengerKey = ref.watch(messengerProvider);
return MaterialApp(
  scaffoldMessengerKey: scaffoldMessengerKey,
  // ...
```

This ensures that the global `ScaffoldMessengerState` is accessible throughout the app, avoiding unnecessary UI-bound logic.

### How to Show SnackBars from Business Logic Providers

The `showSnackBar` function should be called from other providers that contain business logic, ensuring a clean separation between logic and UI.

```dart
final messenger = ref.read(messengerProvider);
if (messenger.currentContext?.mounted == true) {
  messenger.currentState!
    .showSnackBar(messenger.currentContext!
      .eventSnackBar(event));
}
```

By checking `messenger.currentContext?.mounted == true` before calling `showSnackBar`, we ensure that the UI is still available before attempting to display a notification.

Here, `eventSnackBar` is an extension method of `BuildContext` that focuses purely on presentation logic, keeping business logic clean and UI-independent.

## Benefits of Separation

* **Simpler UI Components** – Widgets only call logic, they don’t hold it.

* **Easier Debugging & Testing** – Business logic can be tested independently.

* **Reusable Across the App** – The logic remains consistent across different screens.

## Conclusion

Business logic should always be decoupled from UI, making it easier to reuse, test, and maintain. **Sharing clean, essential examples of business logic** allows others to understand core concepts without UI distractions. Tools like **Riverpod** help achieve this separation, ensuring a scalable and modular codebase.
