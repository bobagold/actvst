## Building a Mobile App Without a Traditional Backend

In the realm of mobile development, the typical approach involves a robust backend to handle authentication, data storage, and business logic. However, I recently explored the possibility of developing a whole mobile app with OpenID authentication and a custom server API without a traditional backend implementation. 

### My Approach

I achieved this by leveraging Keycloak as a Service for OpenID authentication, which provided a seamless way to manage user identity and access. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of my approach:

1. **Using Keycloak as a Service**
   - [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is an open-source identity and access management solution. By using it [as a service](https://www.cloud-iam.com), I was able to implement OpenID authentication without needing to set up my own authentication server. Keycloak handles user authentication, providing secure token-based access right out of the box.

2. **Mock API with OpenAPI Specification**
   - Instead of developing a full-fledged backend, I wrote an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to define the endpoints and their responses for my application's API. This specification acts as a contract for what my app expects from the server, improving collaboration and clarity between teams.

3. **Using Stoplight Prism for Mocking**
   - To simulate a server environment, I utilized [Stoplight Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism), which can spin up a mock service based on the OpenAPI specification I created. Prism allows for both static mock responses and [dynamic response generation](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/blob/master/docs/guides/01-mocking.md). This real-time generation is powered by the Faker library, enabling me to create realistic data responses that resemble what a real server would provide.

### Advantages of This Approach

- **Reduced Development Time**: By using ready-to-go services like Keycloak and Prism, I saved time that would have been spent on backend setup and maintenance.
  
- **Focus on Frontend Development**: This approach allowed me to concentrate more on building the mobile application's frontend, enhancing user experience and interface design without getting bogged down by backend complexities.

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: With a mock API in place, I can easily update the API specification and continue development even as the actual backend is being developed at a later stage or if different backend solutions are considered.

### Conclusion

Developing a mobile app with OpenID authentication and a custom server API without traditional backend implementation is entirely feasible, especially with robust tools and services at our disposal. By leveraging Keycloak for authentication and Stoplight Prism for mock APIs, it is possible to create a fully functional application environment that allows for rapid development and iteration.
