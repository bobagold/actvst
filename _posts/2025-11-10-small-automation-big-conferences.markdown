Today I built an **n8n workflow** that will remind me to update this website more often.  
Let's see how that goes — a bit of automation to keep me accountable. ⚙️  

Last week, I attended the [**JAX Munich**](https://jax.de/muenchen/) conference,  
which turned out to be about **80% full of AI buzzwords**.  
It seems like AI has truly taken over the stage — so I might end up posting here even more often than before.  

Back in **September**, I was at [**FlutterCon**](https://www.fluttercon.dev/),  
which surprisingly had **much less AI** and much more practical, hands-on content.  
I'm planning to share a few takeaways and insights from that experience in the next posts. Stay tuned. ✨
